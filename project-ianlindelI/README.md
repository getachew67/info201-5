# Education and other Economic Factors

We are interested in the cost of education and how it relates to other economic factors. We find this domain interesting because it enables us to take a deeper look into the details surrounding our college experience and the state we live in. This is a relevant socio-economic issue worthy of investigating given the increasingly high cost of accessing postsecondary education. We are particularly interested in evaluating the connection between tuition rates, student loan debt, minimum wage, and workforce composition.

## Data Sources and Information

[Buzzfeed News Tuition and Minimum Wage Data](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2014-09-tuition-and-minimum-wage/tree/master/data)

This data was collected by Buzzfeed News, from three higher education institutions and public records on minimum wage statewise and farmwise. The data ranges from 1976 to 2014. Data was pulled from a Buzzfeed [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2014-09-tuition-and-minimum-wage/tree/master/data) and contains information on the cost of tuition and minimum wage for both years. There are 3 rows in the dataset, with each row representing a higher education institution. The data also has 5 columns. From this data we ask: *how has college affordability changed in the last 40 years? How does this relate to the workload of young adults?*

[Federal Minimum Wage for Nonfarm Workers for the United States](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDMINNFRWG)

The data was downloaded from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDMINNFRWG) for economic research. The data was collected by gathering statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division. It contains the federal minimum hourly wage for each month starting from January of 1939 up until April of 2019. There are 967 rows with each indicating a new month, and two columns with one indicating the date and another the federal minimum hourly wage. From this data we ask: *How have salaries fluctuated over time? Does tuition increase or decrease with a change in the minimum wage?*

This data was collected from understanding the trends in college tuition data by state from 2004 to 2018. We also have a calculated change from year to year that shows the one year change and the 5 year change. There are 106 rows, mainly showing the states in the US, with a separation by 2 and 4 year universities. There are 34 columns, mainly showing the years and changes in two year and four year data for tuitions based on state. From this data we ask: *What state has the best in state tuition rates in the past five years? How does this compare with the cost of living in that state?*
